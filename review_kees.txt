Dear Pavel,

As promised, I'm sending some initial guidance on revisions to 
your AWR manuscript because we have only 30 days to revise it, 
and it is unlikely it will make it into the special issue if I 
have to send it out for re-review.  I hope you will not take 
offense to my comments. I am being blunt to save your time and 
faithfully represent the wishes of the guest editors and the 
editor-in-chief. My comments are prefaced by CEK:

CEK: Note that the theta form/saturation form is given in 1, 
not the mixed form (2 is the mixed form), 3 is the head-based 
form, which is not mass conservative unless you use  the so-called 
chord-slope approximation to theta derivative.

CEK: Alt and Luckhaus doesn't cover all possible saturation 
distributions in the analysis

CEK: The last two paragraphs in section 3 do address reviewer 2's 
comment 3 in a sense. It would be nice to use a problem for which 
spectral element methods and straight p-adaptivity don't work. Do 
you not have a fairly well studied example of such a case?

****

CEK: 4-45: You should note that discontinuous initial conditions 
are extremely common in applications.  

**** 

CEK: 5-50: Comment that higher-order time discretization would be 
more appropriate and is a topic of future and past research. You 
can cite mine and Miller/Kelley papers on adaptive variable order 
BDF methods for RE and two-phase flow in porous media where we 
showed that even low-order discretizations benefit form higher-order 
adaptive time discretizations.

****

CEK: 9-37: Add Miller_Williams_98 reference in context of spline 
approximations. Also note in general it's been found that 
differentiating the spline is the right thing to do, not splining 
the derivatives. These techniques are widely used in multiphase 
flow in porous media due to the expense of evaluating the 
constitutive relations and the degeneracies of many models at 
extreme values of the saturation.

****

CEK: Add discussions of the behavior of hp vs h for the test 
problems including quantitative descriptions. Looks like  hp is 
about twice as fast  over all as h-p=1, but be precise (quantitatively 
and qualitatively) and give a critical evaluation. During infiltration 
it looks like there is no difference an h-p=2 looks like it provides 
quite a bit of "bang for the buck".  Real world applications typically 
contain smooth and rough phases in both space and time so what h-p buys 
you may depend on the regimes one most often addresses. Although your 
results show that h-p is not slower, it's all presumably done in the 
same implementation so it's possible that an optimized fixed h and/or 
p method would win in terms of CPU time for purely rapid infiltraiton 
problems.

CEK: Disregard the comment about Section 7 and go in the direction of more 
detail as indicated by  Reviewer #1's original comment (as well as 
confidential comments to the editors on your latest version):

CEK: You and the reviewer misjudge the AWR readership, which includes many 
mathematicians and computational scientists: details of mathematical methods 
and algorithms should be given in order to make the results reproducible. 
You can do so by increasing the level of detail in the current section 7 
and adding appendices if necessary to prevent derivations from disrupting 
the flow.

CEK: See comment above

CEK: As I stated above, initial singularities are relevant in real applications. 
The RE solutions for infiltration into dry media are really space-time singularities. 
I would clean up your discussion and leave the issue open for future work, though 
as I mentioned, we have previous work with adaptive BDF's for lower order spatial 
discretizations that do show that higher-order convergence in time is achieved by 
higher order BDF's even for low-order space discretizations. My guess would be 
that sufficiently regularized hp-discretizations would gain even more from higher-order 
time discretizations.

I am going to be busy for the next couple of days, but maybe we can discuss some of these 
issues in Reno next week.

Best Regards,
Chris
